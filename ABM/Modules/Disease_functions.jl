    #% PHYTOTHERA SPREAD
    """
    Function implements the spread of a soil-borne Phytothera like disease, e.g. Kauri dieback. The
    spread function follows a similar design to a number of implemented Phytothera (and other 
    disease) spread models, e.g. Harwood et al. (2009). This disease spread model is broadly a
    SEI (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected) model, with no recovery or immunity. The function contains
    two main exposure methods, global and local both of which may only act on a susceptible target
    species, defined in the demography input file. The global exposure method is a simple random
    exposure, where the probability of exposure is defined by the `phyto_global_infection_prob`
    user input. The local exposure probability is density dependent, with each infected neighbour
    tree within the `phyto_infectious_radius` having an equal chance of infecting a susceptible
    target tree. The probability of infection is defined by the `phyto_local_infection_prob` user
    input.

    ## Arguments
    - `agent`: Agent object of type `GridAgent` with properties matching those defined by the 
    current model being exposed to the disease.
    - `model`: The AgentBasedModel object defining the current model. This object is usually 
    created using `Agents.ABM()`.
    - `global_infection_prob::Float64`: Probability of a susceptible target tree being infected by 
    the disease, if exposed to the disease by the global exposure method.
    - `phyto_local_prob::Float64`: Probability of a susceptible target tree being infected by the
    disease, if exposed by one of its infected neighbours. Note this probability is retested
    for each infected neighbour.
    - `infectious_radius::Int64`: Radius of the local exposure method, i.e. the number of
    cells around the target tree that may infect it.
    - `transmission_age::Int64`: Age (i.e. ticks since infection) at which a tree is capable of 
    transimitting the disease to the target tree. This is tested for each infected neighbour.
    - `pos::Tuple{Int64,Int64}`: Position of the target tree in the model grid.
